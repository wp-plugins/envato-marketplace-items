Retrieves items from an Envato Marketplace and API set of your choice, then show the results as a sidebar thumbnail gallery.

== Description ==

The **Envato Marketplace Items** plugin retrieves items from an Envato Marketplace and API set of your choice, then caches and shows the results as a gallery of 80px square thumbnails. Anywhere on your blog you would like to see the thumbnail gallery add `<?php if (function_exists('envato_marketplace_items')) { envato_marketplace_items(); } ?>`.  

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `envato-marketplace-itmes` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `<?php if (function_exists('envato_marketplace_items')) { envato_marketplace_items(); } ?>` in your theme (sidebar.php recommended). Or, use the built in widget.
